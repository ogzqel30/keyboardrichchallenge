# Keyboard Rich Challenge Review: 5 Days, 100% Free, and Potentially Life-Changing

So I've been down the rabbit hole of "make money online" stuff for way too long. Dropshipping, affiliate marketing, selling digital products, crypto—you name it, I've dabbled in it, and most of it went exactly nowhere.

Then someone mentioned virtual bookkeeping, and I thought: *that sounds incredibly boring.* Which is probably why it actually works.

Let me tell you about the **5-Day Keyboard Rich Bookkeeping Challenge** and why it's worth 90 minutes of your day for a week.

## What Is the Keyboard Rich Challenge?

It's a free, 5-day live virtual event hosted by **Bill Von Fumetti**, founder of Booming Bookkeeping Business and author of the *Wall Street Journal* best-selling book *Keyboard Rich*. Bill has helped over 8,000 people start their own virtual bookkeeping businesses, and he does this challenge a few times a year to walk complete beginners through the basics.

The next round runs **Monday, February 23rd through Friday, February 27th, 2026**, at 9am PT / 12pm EST each day. Each session is 90 minutes. It's broadcast over Zoom, replays are available if you can't attend live, and—genuinely—it costs nothing.

## Why Bookkeeping, Though?

Here's the thing that surprised me when I first looked into this.

Most "online businesses" come with a brutal reality: the overwhelming majority of people trying MLM, dropshipping, day trading, or selling online courses never turn a profit. Like, ever. Meanwhile, businesses—every single business—*legally have to do their books.* There is no "algorithm change" that makes bookkeeping irrelevant. There's no market saturation. Demand is just... always there.

According to a study by Intuit (the company behind QuickBooks), the average bookkeeping business owner earns around **$76/hour**. That works out to well over $100,000 a year. And you can run the whole thing from your laptop, from wherever you want.

Bill himself was managing a fitness center, stressed out, barely making ends meet, having night terrors—until he had a conversation with the gym's bookkeeper. She was working from home, charging $3,000/month *per client*, and serving multiple clients at once. Bill didn't know anything about accounting. He learned anyway. A couple of years later, he had a multiple six-figure bookkeeping business and was getting asked by Hawaiian waitresses how he seemed to be on vacation all the time.

That's the pitch. And honestly? It holds up.

## What Happens Each Day

Here's a quick breakdown of the 5-day curriculum:

| Day | Topic | What You'll Walk Away With |
|-----|-------|---------------------------|
| **Day 1** | What is a virtual bookkeeping business? | Why bookkeeping beats every other "make money online" idea, and what you actually need to get started |
| **Day 2** | How bookkeeping actually works | A live, over-the-shoulder look at QuickBooks—even if you're terrified of math |
| **Day 3** | How to never mess up a client's books | Your free QuickBooks Online Accountant account set up live, click by click |
| **Day 4** | Getting clients (the lazy introvert way) | Simple strategies to land recurring clients without cold calling or going viral |
| **Day 5** | Turning prospects into paying clients | A 3-question script, exact pricing guidance, and a bonus on making your business semi-passive |

The whole arc of the week takes you from "I don't even know what bookkeeping is" to "I have the tools and a plan to get my first paying client." That's a lot of ground to cover in five 90-minute sessions, but people consistently say Bill over-delivers.

## Who Is This Actually For?

Bill is pretty upfront about it. This isn't for everyone, but it's for a lot of people:

- People who want to leave their 9–5 but have no idea what to do instead
- Stay-at-home parents ready to earn money on their own schedule
- Already-working bookkeepers or accountants who want to go independent
- Retirees or semi-retirees who want flexible income without full-time hours
- Anyone who's tried the "make money online" thing and keeps getting burned

If any of that sounds like you, the challenge is probably worth your week.

## What Students Are Saying

The testimonials on the page are pretty striking. Not vague "this changed my life!" stuff—actual numbers:

- **Daily W.** hit six figures in less than a year after starting with no bookkeeping background
- **Pamela** landed her first client at $1,495/month plus a $10,000 cleanup fee
- **Jim** crossed $200,000 in annual billing without spending a dollar on marketing
- **Lauren S.** replaced her salary within her first month after leaving restaurant management
- **Edge** signed a $22,000 cleanup deal plus $1,000/month recurring after just 6 days

These are all anecdotal and your results will obviously vary—but it's not cherry-picked fluff. There are enough specific stories with specific numbers that it reads as credible.

## Any Catches?

The honest answer is: not really, for the free challenge itself. Bill does mention at the end there will be an opportunity to work with him more closely (presumably a paid program). That's standard for this type of event and he's upfront about it. You're not required to buy anything to participate in or benefit from the 5-day challenge.

The business itself does require effort. Bookkeeping is a learnable skill, but "learnable" still means you have to actually learn it. And getting clients takes some real-world follow-through, not just watching videos.

But as far as free challenges go, this one is unusually substantive.

## Should You Register?

If you've been spinning your wheels trying to find a legitimate, flexible way to earn money—and you have 90 minutes a day for five days—then yes, you should register.

It's free. The worst case is you spend a week learning something useful and it doesn't pan out. The best case is you're looking at a different life by spring.
